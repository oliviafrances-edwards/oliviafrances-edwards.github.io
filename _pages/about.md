Howdy! I'm a second year PhD student in economics at Texas A&M with research intrests in industrial organization and public economics. Before coming to TAMU, I recieved my undergraduate degree in economics from Millsaps College in Jackson, MS. While at Millsaps, I was a research assistant for Dr. Alex Rice in the mathematics department and worked for members of the Mississippi Congressional delegation and several state legislators. 

My publications, working papers, and academic experience can be found in the tabs above.
