Howdy! I'm a second year PhD student in economics at Texas A&M with research interests in industrial organization and public economics. Before coming to TAMU, I received my undergraduate degree in economics from Millsaps College in Jackson, MS. While at Millsaps, I was a research assistant for Dr. Alex Rice in the mathematics department and worked for members of the Mississippi Congressional delegation and several state legislators.
