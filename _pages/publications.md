## Publications 

### "Sets in Rd determining k taxicab distances"
###### Involve vol. 13 (2020), no. 3, 487-509.
---
We address an analog of a problem introduced by Erdős and Fishburn, itself an inverse formulation of the famous Erdős distance problem, in which the usual Euclidean distance is replaced with the metric induced by the l 1-norm, commonly referred to as the taxicab metric. Specifically, we investigate the following question: given d, k ∈ N, what is the maximum size of a subset of R d that determines at most k distinct taxicab distances, and can all such optimal arrangements be classified? We completely resolve the question in dimension d= 2, as well as the k= 1 case in dimension d= 3, and we also provide a full resolution in the general case under an additional hypothesis.

### "Lattice Configurations Determining Few Distances"
###### INTEGERS vol. 20 (2020), Paper A86.
---
We begin by revisiting a paper of Erdős and Fishburn, which posed the following question: given k ∈ N, what is the maximum number of points in a plane that determine at most k distinct distances, and can such optimal configurations be classified? We rigorously verify claims made in remarks in that paper, including the fact that the vertices of a regular polygon, with or without an additional point at the center, cannot form an optimal configuration for any k ≥ 7. Further, we investigate configurations in both triangular and rectangular lattices studied by Erdős and Fishburn. We collect a large amount of data related to these and other configurations, some of which correct errors in the original paper, and we use that data and additional analysis to provide explanations and make conjectures.
