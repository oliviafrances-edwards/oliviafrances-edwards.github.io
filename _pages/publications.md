### "Sets in Rd determining k taxicab distances"
Involve vol. 13 (2020), no. 3, 487-509.

Vajresh Balaji, Olivia Edwards, Anne Marie Loftin, Solomon Mcharo, Lo Phillips, Alex Rice, Bineyam Tsegaye

We address an analog of a problem introduced by Erdős and Fishburn, itself an inverse formulation of the famous Erdős distance problem, in which the usual Euclidean distance is replaced with the metric induced by the l 1-norm, commonly referred to as the taxicab metric. Specifically, we investigate the following question: given d, k ∈ N, what is the maximum size of a subset of R d that determines at most k distinct taxicab distances, and can all such optimal arrangements be classified? We completely resolve the question in dimension d= 2, as well as the k= 1 case in dimension d= 3, and we also provide a full resolution in the general case under an additional hypothesis.

### "Lattice Configurations Determining Few Distances"
INTEGERS vol. 20 (2020), Paper A86.

Vajresh Balaji, Olivia Edwards, Anne Marie Loftin, Solomon Mcharo, Lo Phillips, Alex Rice, Bineyam Tsegaye

We begin by revisiting a paper of Erdős and Fishburn, which posed the following question: given k ∈ N, what is the maximum number of points in a plane that determine at most k distinct distances, and can such optimal configurations be classified? We rigorously verify claims made in remarks in that paper, including the fact that the vertices of a regular polygon, with or without an additional point at the center, cannot form an optimal configuration for any k ≥ 7. Further, we investigate configurations in both triangular and rectangular lattices studied by Erdős and Fishburn. We collect a large amount of data related to these and other configurations, some of which correct errors in the original paper, and we use that data and additional analysis to provide explanations and make conjectures.

### "School Choice and Charter Market Power: An Analysis of Charter School Management Organization Merger and Acquisitions"
2023

Drawing upon the traditional Industrial Organization (IO) framework, the analysis focuses on identifying the factors influencing CMO M\&A decisions, the patterns of consolidation, and the effects on educational outcomes and organizational efficiency. The findings reveal that CMO mergers and acquisitions are primarily driven by the pursuit of economies of scale, improved operational efficiency, and expanded geographic reach. Additionally, strategic considerations such as market dominance, resource pooling, and increased bargaining power play significant roles in shaping these transactions. The empirical analysis showcases how CMO consolidation impacts student performance, teacher retention, and overall educational quality.

### "Evaluating the Effects of and Parental Preferences for Special Education"
2023

Employing an oversubscribed lottery-IV identification strategy, we examine the effects of attending these specialized charter schools on various educational outcomes for students with special education (SPED) needs. Additionally, we investigate treatment effect heterogeneity by exploring the impact of different instructional styles within these schools. We explore the alignment between parental preferences and the effectiveness of instructional approaches in catering to the needs of SPED students. By examining the results from the oversubscribed lottery-IV identification, we are able to identify the causal effects of attending SPED-oriented charter schools on academic achievement, social-emotional development, and other key outcomes. Moreover, we delve into parental preferences for SPED educational settings through the application of a structural demand model. This analysis enables us to assess whether parental preferences align with the reduced-form evidence on instructional effectiveness for SPED students. By comparing parental preferences with the outcomes observed in the oversubscribed lottery-IV identification, we gain insights into potential misalignments and areas of improvement in meeting the needs of SPED students.-->
